## Cloudflare Worker Based OAuth Proxy

This is a simple Proxy using Cloudflare worker to make authenticated requests to Prokerala API without bundling your OAuth2 credentials with your Native applications.

We use cloudflare [`wrangler`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) tool in the instructions below. It is possible to create the Key Value namesspaces and worker directly from your Cloudflare dashboard.

## Configuration

### Credentials

Update `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` variables in `index.js` with the Client id and client secret from your Prokerala API Dashboard.

### Rate Limiting

The script allows adding rate limits by IP Address to prevent abuse. You can add multiple (per user) rate limits by modifying the `RATE_LIMITS` variable.

## Local Testing

Create KV namespace for previewing and update `wrangler.toml` with the generated `preview_id`.

```
wrangler kv:namespace create --preview TOKEN
wrangler kv:namespace create --preview USER_COUNT
```

Start the local web server for testing by running

```
wrangler dev
```

## Production

Create KV namespace for production and update `wrangler.toml` with the generated `id`.

```
wrangler kv:namespace create TOKEN
wrangler kv:namespace create USER_COUNT
```

Deploy to Cloudflare worker edge with

```
wrangler publish
```

This will output a message like the following with your Cloudflare worker hostname.

> âœ¨  Successfully published your script to
> https://prokerala-api-proxy.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev

Now you can access the API without authentication by using the worker hostname, instead of `api.prokerala.com`. For example, 
try visiting the following url after replacing `<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>` with your actual Cloudflare worker subdomain.

```
https://prokerala-api-proxy.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/v2/astrology/panchang?datetime=2004-02-12T15:19:21Z&ayanamsa=1&coordinates=10.21,78.09
```

## Security

While this script protects your credentials, inspection of the application can reveal the URL of your proxy service.
A malicious user can still make requests on your behalf by using the Proxy URL. Rate limit is the first step towards 
preventing abuse.

To further secure your API from unauthorized access, you need to authenticate each user from within the proxy script 
before allowing the request. If your app already has user authentication, you may use a per-user API Key instead of 
IP address for rate limiting. This limits the API access to users of your app, and if you detect suspicious activity 
from a particular API key, you can revoke that key without affecting other clients.

A more secure approach is to use a form of client authentication that doesn't require distributing secret keys to 
clients. For example, you might use a system where the client authenticates to your server (possibly using a username 
and password, or a federated identity system like OAuth), and your server issues a short-lived, signed token that the 
client can use to authenticate to the proxy service.
